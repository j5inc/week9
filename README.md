# Project 9 - Honeypots


### Honeypots Deployed: 

  I used the Modern Honey Network (MHN) to complete the assignment for Week 9. In total, I created five Ubuntu 14.04 honeypots. All of the honeypots, including the MHN admin web application, were hosted in the Google Cloud.

Honeypots: 
* Ubuntu 14.04- Dionaea with HTTP
*The goal of dionaea is to trap malware that exploits vulnerabilties in an exposed network. Once trapped, reserach can be done to determine the functions of the malware.

* Ubuntu 14.04 - Wordpot 
*WordPot is a WordPress honeypot designed to trap attacks that are targeting WordPress servers.

* Ubuntu 14.04 - ElasticHoney
*ElasticHoney is an elasticsearch honeypot designed to catch attackers exploiting RCE vulnerabilities in elasticsearch.

* Ubuntu 14.04 - Amun
*Amun also has a goal of capturing malware in an automated fashion.

* Ununtu 14.04 - Shockpot
*Shockpot is a honeypot designed to find those attempting to exploit the Bash remote code vulnerability CVE-2014-6271.
